* grab every instance of "pok" and change it to "poke". - command-D

* grab every instance of 'af' _as a word_, regardless of capitalization, and delete it - multi-cursor

* grab every instance of "irony" or "ironic" and put "post-" in front of it--if it's already there, double it.

* pick a sentence halfway through each paragraph and make a new paragraph at the end of it.

* Move the second paragraph down to the end of the document.
